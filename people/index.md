<b> Alejandro Llanos-Garrido (postdoc, Oct 2025–ongoing). </b> Alejandro was hired under the EVOMORPH project, and he works combining large morphological datasets and biophysical models contributing to our understanding of how body size relates to ecological and climatic factors.

<b> Beatriz Saldanha (PhD student, Oct 2024–ongoing). </b> Beatriz’s doctoral research examines how climate warming affects steppe birds, integrating physiological, spatial, and behavioral responses to understand consequences for reproductive success. Supervisors: João Paulo Silva (CIBIO), Ana Teresa Marques (CIBIO), Juan G. Rubalcaba (UCM).

<b> Enzo de Nicolás (MSc student, Nov 2025–ongoing). </b> Enzo’s master’s thesis explores how body size, shape, and coloration influence thermoregulation in odonates, using an experimental approach. Supervisors: Juan G. Rubalcaba (UCM), Roberto Novella-Fernández (University of Würzburg).

<b> Estefanía García Felipe (MSc student, Jan 2026–ongoing). </b> Estefanía is developing thermoregulatory models for lizards to predict responses to climate warming and extreme thermal variation.

<b> Pablo Ortigosa (BSc student, Nov 2025–ongoing). </b> Pablo’s undergraduate project takes a comparative approach to investigate biogeographic patterns of body size and shape in lizards.

<h2> Past members </h2>
<b> Marta Correas-Araus (research assistant, Nov 2024–Dec 2025). </b> Marta focuses on compiling metabolic data in mammals. Her work has led to a scientific manuscript currently under review. Preprint: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6651627/v1

<b> Sofía Travieso (MSc student, completed Sept 2025). </b> Sofía studied how body size influences heat balance in lizards through experimental work.

<b> Andrea Vara (BSc student, completed June 2025).</b> Andrea examined how body mass and microclimate affect metabolism in birds and mammals.
