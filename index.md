      <h5>Welcome to my site!</h5>
      I am an ecologist interested in ecological modeling, computing and simulation of ecological processes across scales.
      Currently, I am a Marie-Curie fellow working with <a href="http://jennsunday.weebly.com/"> Jennifer Sunday </a> in McGill University (Montreal).

    <h5>News</h5>
    The last paper of my postdoc at <a href=""> Bioma lab</a> is finally out! We use biophysical models to address a classic question "are large lizards experiencing warmer body temperatures?". Apparently yes, but only at low latitudes, and it means that they are more at risk of overheating than small lizards.
