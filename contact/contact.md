## A little about me

I am a reasearch engineerand a exotic plant aficionado. I use the finite element method and computational fluid dynamics to solve industrial problems. In 2016 I graduated from the University of Manchester with a Beng in Mechanical Engineering and was fortunate enough to be accepted on the EDF Energy Research & Development Scheme that has sponsored my masters degree. In December 2018 I will graduate with a MSc in Nuclear Science and Technology from the University of Manchester.
