**Can we explain complex patterns in biology by just looking at the physical, physiological and behavioural mechanisms that determine how organisms interact with their environment and with other organisms?** The answer to this question is not trivial and sometimes requires novel theory capable of integrating research areas with contrasted approahces and traditions such as physics, physiology and ecology. In my research, I combine theory and data to understand broad patterns in ecology and evolution from first physical principles, physiological and behavioural processes.

**The role of physiology and behaviour in determining broad-scale ecological patterns and organismal responses to environmental change**


**Sexual selection, demography and the evolution of behaviour in birds**
