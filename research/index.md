**Can we explain patterns in ecology by looking at simple mechanisms underpinning organism-environment and organism-organism interactions?** The answer is not trivial. In biology, we need to develop theory that integrates different research areas with contrasted approahces and traditions such as physics, physiology and ecology. In my work, I combine theory and data to understand the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underpining animal behaviour and the emergence of broad-scale ecological patterns.


<h4> Projecting global biodiversity responses from first biological principles (SCALE) </h4>

<p>Realistic projections of the biological impacts of climate change require a unified framework capable of integrating advances from distinct research areas such as ecophysiology, behavioural ecology, and biogeography. Mechanistic modelling in macroecology arises as a promising framework to address this challenge, because it aims at describing biodiversity patterns from biophysical, physiological, and behavioural processes determining the way organisms interact with their environment. Nonetheless, mechanistic modelling face further challenges such as the need to connect processes across scales and levels of ecological organization: e.g., to assess the impacts of individual-environment interactions into population and community structure.</p>
<p>SCALE is a Marie-Curie funded project that investigates how organismal-microclimate interactions influence broad-scale patterns and thermal adaptations of ectotherms, a group that is especially vulnerable to global change, across climatic gradients.</p>
<p>The project brings together three researchers with backgrounds in evolutionary ecology and modelling (Juan G. Rubalcaba, postdoctoral fellow), and macroecology (Jennifer Sunday, supervisor at McGill University, Montreal) and Miguel Á. Ollala-Tárraga (supervisor at Rey Juan Carlos University, Madrid).</p>

<h4> Connecting ecological processes across scales </h4>

<p> Macroecology and macrophysiology investigate the causes of broad-scale ecological patterns such as the latitudinal diversity gradient (species richness decreases from the tropics to the poles), latitudinal gradients of body size (the Bergmann's rule), or the latitudinal variation in physiological traits of organisms living in warm or cold regions. We need to understand these mechanisms 
to develop models capable of predicting the organismal responses to climate change.</p>

<p>I develop mechanistic models based on physical processes (heat and mass transfer) to understand how organisms interact with their   environment and then scale-up these calculations to generate predictions at broad spatial scales. For example, undertanding how body size and shape of cold-blooded animals determine body temperature and evaporative water loss, allows understanding why many lizards are smaller at warm latitudes or why amphibians are bigger in dry regions.</p>

<h4> Natural and sexual selection in the evolution of animal behaviour </h4>

<figure class = "half">
<img src="/images/tree.jpg" height="370px" width="400px"> 

<p>Animal behaviour, life history and morphology are not only the result of current ecological factors but also historical proccesses involving evolutionary forces such as natural and sexual selection. For example, many animals display elaborated behaviours during reproduction to attract the opposite sex or signal their condition to competitors. Understanding the ultimate causes of these behaviours is often challeging as they arise from a complex interplay between natural and sexual selection. </p>

<p> I investigate the ultimate causes of life history traits, reproductive decissions and sexual behaviours by looking at both the ecological factors that influence behavioural displays and the evolutionary history of specific behaviours.</p>
