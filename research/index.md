**Can we explain complex patterns in biology by just looking at the physical, physiological and behavioural mechanisms underpinning organism-environment and organism-organism interactions?** The answer to this question is not trivial, we need to develop new theory and integrate different research areas with contrasted approahces and traditions such as physics, physiology and ecology. In my work, I combine theory and data to understand broad patterns in ecology and evolution from first physical principles, physiological constraints and behavioural processes.



<h3>Mechanisms of broad-scale ecological patterns</h3>

<p>In macroecology and macrophysiology, we investigate the causes of broad-scale ecological patterns such as the latitudinal diversity gradient (species richness decreases with increasing latitude), latitudinal gradients of body size (the Bergmann's rule), or the latitudinal variation in physiological traits of organisms living in warm or cold regions. Understanding the mechanisms causing these variety of patterns is important to forecast how organisms will respond to environmental and climate change.</p>

<p>I develop mechanistic models based on physical processes (heat and mass transfer) to understand how organisms interact with their   environment and then scale-up these calculations to generate predictions at broad spatial scales. For example, undertanding how body size and shape of cold-blooded animals determine body temperature and evaporative water loss, allows understanding why many lizards are smaller at warm latitudes or why amphibians are bigger in dry regions.</p>
