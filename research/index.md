Now more than ever, ecologists face the challenge of predicting how diversity will respond to a changing environment, which requires integrating theories and methods from disciplines such as physiology, population ecology, biogeography, and macroecology. I'm interested in developing theory that connects these ideas and ultimately understand the causes of the broad-scale patterns that we observe in macroecology and biogeography.

          <p>Realistic projections of the biological impacts of climate change require a unified framework capable of integrating advances from distinct research areas such as ecophysiology, behavioural ecology, and biogeography. Mechanistic modelling in macroecology arises as a promising framework to address this challenge, because it aims at describing biodiversity patterns from biophysical, physiological, and behavioural processes determining the way organisms interact with their environment. Nonetheless, mechanistic modelling face further challenges such as the need to connect processes across scales and levels of ecological organization.</p>
          <p>SCALE is a Marie-Curie funded project that investigates how organismal-microclimate interactions influence broad-scale patterns and thermal adaptations of ectotherms, a group that is especially vulnerable to global change, across climatic gradients.</p>
          <p>The project brings together three researchers with backgrounds in evolutionary ecology and modelling (Juan G. Rubalcaba, postdoctoral fellow), and macroecology (Jennifer Sunday, supervisor at McGill University, Montreal) and Miguel Á. Ollala-Tárraga (supervisor at Rey Juan Carlos University, Madrid).</p>

<h4> The biophysics of body size and climate </h4>

<img src="/images/maps.jpg" height="370px" width="400px"> 

<p> Body size is the most important variable determining how animals interact with their environment, modulating their physiology, metabolism, behaviour, and life history. Most of these traits scale with size following specific "allometric rules" governed by physical processes such as the exchange of energy (heat) and mass (water, oxygen, or nutrients) between the animal and its environment. Although this may sound purely theoretical, it is actually critical to understand these processes to explain, for example, why many organisms are smaller in warmer areas, and why many animals are shrinking body size in response to climate warming. </p>

<p>I use biophysical models that describe how animals exchange heat and mass with their environments. I use these models to predict how body size determines body temperature of lizards, water loss in amphibians, or the dynamics of oxygen demand and supply in aquatic ectotherms such as fish. </p>

<h4> Natural and sexual selection in the evolution of animal behaviour </h4>

<figure class = "half">
<img src="/images/tree.jpg" height="370px" width="400px"> 

<p>Animal behaviour, life history and morphology are not only the result of current ecological factors but also historical proccesses involving evolutionary forces such as natural and sexual selection. For example, many animals display elaborated behaviours during reproduction either to attract the opposite sex, or signal their condition to competitors. Understanding the ultimate causes of these behaviours is often challeging as they arise from a complex interplay between natural and sexual selection. </p>

<p> I investigate the ultimate causes of life history traits, reproductive decissions and sexual behaviours by looking at both the ecological factors that influence behavioural displays, and the evolutionary history of specific behaviours.</p>
