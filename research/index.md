**Can we explain complex patterns in biology by just looking at the physical, physiological and behavioural mechanisms determining organism-environment and organism-organism interactions?** The answer to this question is not trivial, we need to develop novel theory and integrate different research areas with contrasted approahces and traditions such as physics, physiology and ecology. In my work, I combine theory and data to understand broad patterns in ecology and evolution from first physical principles, physiological constraints and behavioural processes.

**The role of physiology and behaviour in determining broad-scale ecological patterns**
In macroecology and macrophysiology, we investigate the causes of broad-scale ecological patterns such as the latitudinal gradient in species richenss, variations in animal body size across climatic gradients (e.g., the Bergmann's rule), or variations in physiological traits such as optimal and tolerance capacity to different temperatures experienced by organisms living at different latitudes. Understanding the mechanisms causing these variety of patterns is important if we want to forecast how organisms will respond to environmental and climate change. 

I develop mechanistic models based on physical processes (heat and mass transfer dynamics) to understand how organisms interact with their environment and then scale-up these calculations to generate predictions at broad spatial scales. For example, understanding how body size and shape of cold-blooded animals determine their body temperature and the amount of water that they lose from evaporation, we can understand why many lizards are smaller at warm latitudes or why amphibians are bigger in drier environments.
