<h4> Biophysical constraints on the evolution of lizard morphology </h4>
<figure class = "half">
  <img src="/images/evomorph.png">
  <p> Climate fundamentally affects physiological performance and fitness in organisms - particularly ectotherms - and thereby modulates the evolution of traits involved in thermreogulation such as body size and shape or the radiative properties of the skin. </p>
  <p> evomorph studies different morphological traits of lizards (e.g., body size and shape and appendage length) testing their role as potential adaptations to extreme environments. We perform 3D reconstructions of lizards and combine them with biophysical models to test how morpohlogy affects heat exchange, body temperature maintentance, and behavioural thermoregulation in desert lizards. Ultimately, we are interested in the mechanisms driving morphological evolution of lizards and develop accurate, mechanism-oriented forecasts of lizards' responses to climate change. </p>

<h4> Assessing the energetic impacts of climate change on biodiversity </h4>
<figure class = "half">
  <img src="/images/TCAM.jpg">
  <p> Climate warming challenges the capacity of organisms to balance heat and water budgets, affeting homostasis, survival, and overall fitness. In this project, we aim to quantify the impacts of warming on energy metabolism in both endotherms and ecotherms, across global climatic gradients. </p>
  <p> The project combines field metabolic rates collected from the literature covering more than 3 decades of empirical research and biophysical models, used to gain knowledge on the mechanisms underlying metabolic responses of animals to temperature fluctuations. </p>
