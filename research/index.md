**Can we explain patterns in ecology by looking at simple mechanisms underpinning organism-environment and organism-organism interactions?** The answer is not trivial. In biology, we need to develop theory that integrates different research areas with contrasted approahces and traditions such as physics, physiology and ecology. In my work, I combine theory and data to understand the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underpining animal behaviour and the emergence of broad-scale ecological patterns.

<h4> Physical, physiological and behavioural processes to explain broad-scale ecological patterns </h4>

<p> Macroecology and macrophysiology investigate the causes of broad-scale ecological patterns such as the latitudinal diversity gradient (species richness decreases with increasing latitude), latitudinal gradients of body size (the Bergmann's rule), or the latitudinal variation in physiological traits of organisms living in warm or cold regions. Understanding the mechanisms causing these variety of patterns is important to forecast how organisms will respond to environmental and climate change.</p>

<p>I develop mechanistic models based on physical processes (heat and mass transfer) to understand how organisms interact with their   environment and then scale-up these calculations to generate predictions at broad spatial scales. For example, undertanding how body size and shape of cold-blooded animals determine body temperature and evaporative water loss, allows understanding why many lizards are smaller at warm latitudes or why amphibians are bigger in dry regions.</p>

<h4> Natural and sexual selection in the evolution of animal behaviour </h4>

<p>Animal behaviour, life history and morphology is not only the result of current ecological factors but also historical proccesses involving evolutionary forces such as natural and sexual selection. For example, many animals display elaborated behaviours during reproduction to attract the opposite sex or signal their condition to competitors. Understanding the ultimate causes of these behaviours is often challeging as they arise from a complex interplay between natural and sexual selection. </p>

<p> I investigate the ultimate causes of life history traits, reproductive decissions and sexual behaviours by looking at both the ecological factors that influence behavioural displays and the evolutionary history of specific behaviours.  </p>
