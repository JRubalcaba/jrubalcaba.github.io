Extracting oxygen from the environment -to generate energy for locomotion, growth and reproduction, is especially challenging for aquatic animals because the availability and diffusive capacity of oxygen is much lower in water than in air.

Contrary to warm-blooded animals such as mammals and birds, cold-blooded animals like fish increase their metabolic demand for oxygen as temperature increases. In a warming world, many fish species would experience higher metabolic rates, and therefore, they need to increase oxygen supply rates to meet this demand. However, respiratory organs (gills) and circulatory systems of fish cannot extract and distribute oxygen to tissues at an infinitely high rate. If fishes experience limitations in oxygen supply capacity, warming oceans would reduce their physiological performance which may have an impact on survival.

There is little consensus as to whether fish would experience oxygen limitation in warming waters. This lack of consensus is, in part, due to the fact that we don't have models to calculate maximum oxygen supply rates of respiratory organs of animals. 
One of the most relevant models that ecologists use to calculate how metabolic rates change with temperature and scale with body mass is Metabolic Theory of Ecology (MTE). According to this theory, metabolic rates increase with temperature in an exponential way (the Arrhenius-Boltzmann equation), and scale with body mass as \begin\ \propto M^{3/4}\ \end However, MTE does not include oxygen supply rates, which is equivalent to say that it assumes that oxygen availability is always high enough to meet demand. Although this assumption is valid for resting, terrestrial organisms, it may not represent most aquatic animals.

We introduced oxygen supply into MTE and found that oxygen availability determines both the relationship between metabolic rate and temperature, and the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass. Thus, while MTE predicts that the slope of the relationship between metabolic rate vs temperature is constant (~0.6 eV), the value this slope should decrease under oxygen limitation. Similarly, while MTE predicts that metabolic rates scales as 3/4 with (log) body mass, oxygen limitation reduces the slope of this mass-scaling relationship.

So the temperature and size dependence of metabolism change due to oxygen limitation, but does this result have any implication? We can use this result to investigate, empirically, if oxygen limitation affects fish metabolism. Many empirical studies have measured metabolic rates of differently sized fish at different water temperatures, and compared resting fish (resting metabolic rates, RMR) and active fish (maximum metabolic rates, MMR). We just need to collect these data (which include thousands of measurements across more than 200 fish species) and see if the empirical relationships metabolic rate vs temperature, metabolic rate vs body size, match our model's predictions.

To do this, we need to define our predictions a bit better and make them comparable to empirical data: (1) our model predicts that oxygen limitation reduces the slope of the relationship metabolic rate vs temperature, so we expect that MMR (more oxygen limited because fish are active) increase with temperature at a smaller slope than RMR. (2) the model predicts that oxygen limitation reduces the slope of the mass-scaling relationship, so we expect that the mass-scaling slope decreases at warmer temperatures, especially when the activity level is high (MMR).

These predictions can be directly compared against empirical data:

The empirical results suggest that oxygen limitation determines how metabolic rates change with temperature and body mass, supporting the model's predictions. Of course, life is way more complicated than that (fish can change their activity level to avoid suffocation, or ventilate their gills -we tried to include some of these compensatory mechanisms in the model) and metabolic rates data usually display a lot of dispersion. Our model does not reflect an underpinning law that all fish need to obey (like in physics) but it is useful, because it allows us predicting what would be the patterns if oxygen limitation really modulates fish metabolism.
These results suggest that the limit in oxygen supply capacity of respiratory organs of fish is important. As metabolic rate increases with temperature, many fishes (especially larger individuals) consume oxygen at a rate that is close to the maximum supply capacity of their respiratory organs. This might cause respiratory distress, impairing physiological performance and ultimately reducing survival under climate change.
