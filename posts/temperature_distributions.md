title: "Modelling body temperature of ectotherms"
layout: article
---

Many ectotherms (cold-blooded animals like invertebrates, frogs or lizards) can exploit the heterogeneity of their environment 
selecting microhabitats such as sunny or shaded areas, basking sites or burrows to control body temperature. This capacity for "behavioural thermoregulation" is critical because it allows ectotherms to buffer variations in body temperature and thus the impact of climate warming.

It is important to measure or model the temperatures that organisms experience in each microhabitat to understand how their repertoire will vary under climate change. We use the concept of "operative temperature", defined as the equilibrium temperature of an individual in a microhabitat, to obtain information on the repertoire of microclimates that individuals can use for thermoregulation.

>The operative temperature is the equilibrium temperature of an individual in a microenvironment, and depends on multiple sources and sinks of heat energy, as well as body size, shape and radiative proprieties of the animal.


But knowing the repertoire of operative temperatures is only part of the job. We also need to understand how individuals use these microhabitats to control body temperature throughout the day. For example, if lizards target a preferred temperature of 31ºC and they can select amongst basking sites (operative temperature 37ºC), shaded areas (26ºC) and burrows (21ºC), they will probably move between exposed and shaded areas to maintain body temperature near their preferred value. 

But can we actually estimate this probability? and beyond that, can we model the probability distribution of body temperatures that individuals will experience while moving among microhabitats? This is what we aimed <a href = "https://www.amnat.org/an/newpapers/MayRubalcaba.html" target="_blank"> here </a>, applying the maximum entropy framework, a procedure to derive statistical distributions when we know little about the rules governing the behaviour of the system. 

Using the maximum entropy framework to model behavioural thermoregulation sounds trickier than it is. This is why I'm writting this post (and this <p><a href = "https://jrubalcaba.shinyapps.io/jrubalcabagithub/" target="_blank"> online app </a></p>).
