title: "Modelling body temperature of ectotherms"

Many ectotherms (cold-blooded animals like invertebrates, frogs or lizards) can exploit the heterogeneity of their environment 
selecting microhabitats such as sunny or shaded areas, basking sites or burrows to control body temperature. This capacity for "behavioural thermoregulation" is critical because it allows ectotherms to buffer variations in body temperature and thus the impact of climate warming.

It is important to be able to model the temperature that organisms experience in each microhabitat to understand how this repertoire will vary under climate change. We use the powerfull concept of "operative temperature", defined as the equilibrium temperature of an individual in a microhabitat, to achieve this goal.

However, knowing the repertoire of operative temperatures is only part of the job. We also need to understand how individuals use these microhabitats to control body temperature throughout the day. For example, if individual lizards target a preferred temperature of 31ºC during the day and they can select among exposed areas (operative temperature 37ºC), shaded microenvironments (26ºC) and burrows (21ºC), they will likely move between exposed and shaded areas to maintain body temperature near their preferred value. 

How can we quantify the probability of using each microhabitat? and beyond that, can we model the probability distribution of body temperatures that individuals will experience while moving among microhabitats? We tried to answer these quesntions applying a the maximum entropy theory, a procedure to derive statistical distributions when we know little about the actual rules governing the behaviour of the system.
