title: "Modelling body temperature of ectotherms"
layout: article
---

Many ectotherms (cold-blooded animals such as invertebrates, frogs or lizards) can exploit the heterogeneity of their environment 
selecting sunny or shaded areas, basking sites or burrows to control body temperature. This capacity for "behavioural thermoregulation"
is important because it allows ectotherms to buffer variations in environmental temperatures such as those resulting from climate warming.
